# Express/Postgres

This is a starting point for me to make things with Express quickly inside docker-compose (because 'it worked on my machine' should be a thing of the past). Starting a new application should be as simple as cloning this repo and running `docker-compose up --build`.

# TODO

- [ ] create db/run migrations
- [ ] create user service
- [ ] create match service
- [ ] create prediction service
- [ ] create scoring service
- [ ] find way to get (almost) live scores into the application automagically.
